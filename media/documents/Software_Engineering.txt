Software Engineering is a branch of computer science that deals with the systematic design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications. It applies engineering principles and knowledge of programming languages to build software solutions for end users

Key Principles of Software Engineering

Modularity: Breaking the software into smaller, reusable components that can be developed and tested independently

Abstraction: Hiding the implementation details of a component and exposing only the necessary functionality to other parts of the software

Encapsulation: Wrapping up the data and functions of an object into a single unit, and protecting the internal state of an object from external modifications

Reusability: Creating components that can be used in multiple projects, which can save time and resources

Maintenance: Regularly updating and improving the software to fix bugs, add new features, and address security vulnerabilities

Testing: Verifying that the software meets its requirements and is free of bugs

Design Patterns: Solving recurring problems in software design by providing templates for solving them
